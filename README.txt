not sure if I want to continue this library. It does what I need it to do so far -> given a value, either guess or give all conversions relative to b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb, ex, zb, yb.

goal: The goal was to write this library in a bunch of languages for fun.
reason: Going to port a console progress bar to a bunch of langs. One component figures out the data rate etc.

dno.
